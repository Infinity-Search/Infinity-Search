# About Infinity Search

Infinity Search is a [metasearch engine], aggregating the results of other
{{link('search engines', 'preferences')}} while not storing information about
its users.

## Why use it?

- Infinity Search may not offer you as personalized results as Google, but it doesn't
  generate a profile about you.
- Infinity Search doesn't care about what you search for, never shares anything with a
  third-party, and can't be used to compromise you.

If you do care about privacy, want to be a conscious user, or otherwise believe
in digital freedom, make Infinity Search your default search engine or run it on your
own browser!

## How do I set it as the default search engine?

Infinity Search supports [OpenSearch].  For more information on changing your default
search engine, see your browser's documentation:

- [Firefox]
- [Microsoft Edge] - Behind the link, you will also find some useful instructions
  for Chrome and Safari.
- [Chromium]-based browsers only add websites that the user navigates to without
  a path.

When adding a search engine, there must be no duplicates with the same name.  If
you encounter a problem where you cannot add the search engine, you can either:

- Remove the duplicate (default name: Infinity Search) or
- Contact the owner to give the instance a different name from the default.

## How does it work?

Infinity Search is a well-known [Isearch] [metasearch engine] which was
inspired by the [Infinity project]. It provides basic privacy by mixing your
queries with searches on other platforms without storing search data. Infinity Search
can be added to your browser's search bar; moreover, it can be set as the
default search engine.

## Who Made Infinity Search?

In the vast and ever-changing world of the internet, where most tech innovations come from seasoned professionals and large corporations, **Infinity Search** stands out as a creation with a unique and inspiring origin. It was built not in a corporate office, but in the mind and hands of a 12-year-old boy — **Burhanuddin M. Huzaifa Badnagar** — in the year 2025.

At the time, Burhanuddin was a 6th-grade student with a deep passion for technology, coding, and the endless possibilities of the digital world. Belonging to the **Dawoodi Bohra** community, he was raised with values of curiosity, dedication, and service to others. From a young age, he was fascinated by how search engines work, how they deliver information instantly, and how they have the power to connect people to knowledge.

### The Spark of an Idea  
Burhanuddin noticed that while there were many search engines available, most either compromised on privacy, overloaded users with ads, or lacked the ability to deliver clean and straightforward results. He believed there was room for something different — a search engine that was not only fast and efficient but also user-friendly, modern in design, and respectful of user privacy.

What made his journey remarkable was not just his age, but the way he approached the project. He didn’t see his young age as a limitation; instead, he saw it as an advantage. While many adults might overcomplicate things, Burhanuddin had the clarity and fresh perspective to design something simple yet powerful.

### Building Infinity Search  
The development of Infinity Search was no easy task. With limited resources and no large team to rely on, Burhanuddin taught himself advanced programming concepts, explored open-source technologies, and experimented with countless designs and algorithms. Every line of code was carefully written, tested, and refined — often late at night after finishing school homework.

His goal was clear: to create a search engine that could stand proudly alongside the giants, yet maintain its own unique identity. He focused on speed, accuracy, and a clean user experience. Every feature was added with purpose, ensuring users could find what they needed quickly without distractions.

### A Vision for the Future  
For Burhanuddin, Infinity Search was more than just a personal project — it was the start of a bigger vision. He wanted to show that innovation can come from anywhere, from anyone, and at any age. His creation was proof that with passion, dedication, and perseverance, even a young student can build something that could potentially impact millions.

Infinity Search today stands as a symbol of youthful ambition and technological creativity. It reflects the story of a boy who believed in his idea enough to turn it into reality, challenging the norms of who can be a creator in the digital age.

And this is only the beginning. As Burhanuddin continues his journey, Infinity Search is expected to grow, evolve, and inspire countless others — proving that the spark of innovation knows no boundaries of age, place, or background.
