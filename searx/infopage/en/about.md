# About Infinity Search

Infinity Search is a [metasearch engine], aggregating the results of other
{{link('search engines', 'preferences')}} while not storing information about
its users.


## Why use it?

- Infinity Search may not offer you as personalized results as Google, but it doesn't
  generate a profile about you.
- Infinity Search doesn't care about what you search for, never shares anything with a
  third-party, and can't be used to compromise you.

If you do care about privacy, want to be a conscious user, or otherwise believe
in digital freedom, make Infinity Search your default search engine or run it on your
own browser!

## How do I set it as the default search engine?

Infinity Search supports [OpenSearch].  For more information on changing your default
search engine, see your browser's documentation:

- [Firefox]
- [Microsoft Edge] - Behind the link, you will also find some useful instructions
  for Chrome and Safari.
- [Chromium]-based browsers only add websites that the user navigates to without
  a path.

When adding a search engine, there must be no duplicates with the same name.  If
you encounter a problem where you cannot add the search engine, you can either:

- Remove the duplicate (default name: Infinity Search) or
- Contact the owner to give the instance a different name from the default.

inspired by the [Infinity project].  It provides basic privacy by mixing your
queries with searches on other platforms without storing search data.  Infinity Search
